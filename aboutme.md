After completing 18 months of military service, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery to define my goals and understand what I truly excel at. A quote that profoundly inspired me was, *"I bargained with life for a penny, and life would pay no more."* This taught me the importance of not just acquiring knowledge but putting it into action.
